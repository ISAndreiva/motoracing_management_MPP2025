# motoracing_management_MPP2025
My Project (Motoracing Competions Management) for SDI at BBU.

We had to implement the same project in both Java and C# for the first assignments, then we only kept the backend in one language and the froentend in the other one.
This repository also contains common resources between the 2 implementations.
My implementations:

[Java](https://github.com/ISAndreiva/motoracing_management_MPP2025-java)

[C#](https://github.com/ISAndreiva/motoracing_management_MPP2025-csharp)
